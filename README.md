# M5Module-Stepmotor

## Overview

### SKU:M039

**M5Module-Stepmotor** is adapted to M5 core series, the HR8825 chip solution provides a 3-way bipolar stepper motor control interface. You can implement independent control or multi-axis motor linkage after this module is stacked with M5 core series of the internal ESP32 generates signals directly to the driver chip.

This module integrated TCA9554 IO expansion chip provides 4 sets of input signal terminals + 3 sets of stepper motor subdivision control + 1 set of drive chip enable control, through the I2C interface control, can monitor and control the 8 expansion IO state, as well as for external limit switch, dynamic subdivision adjustment, motor braking.
